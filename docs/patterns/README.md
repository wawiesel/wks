# WKS Organizational Patterns

This directory contains prototype documentation patterns. These patterns document organizational conventions, workflows, and guidelines for managing the knowledge system.

These documentation patterns are ideas preceding the formal executable patterns layer (`~/.wks/patterns/`).

## Pattern Files
