# WKS System Overview

The Wieselquist Knowledge System (WKS) is an AI-assisted file organization and knowledge management system that uses Obsidian as an intelligent layer for maintaining connections and organization across a structured file system.

## Core Principles

1. **Date-based naming** encodes temporal scope and relevance
2. **Hierarchical archiving** (`_old/YYYY/`) keeps workspaces clean
3. **Obsidian as intelligent layer** maintains connections as files move
4. **Desktop as focus workspace** - curated via symlinks
5. **AI agent maintains coherence** between filesystem and knowledge graph
