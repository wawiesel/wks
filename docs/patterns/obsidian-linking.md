# Obsidian Linking Policy

**NEVER link to obsidian from outside obsidian. Obsidian manages the links of our data.**

- External files (in `~/YYYY-projectname/`, `~/Documents/`, etc.) should NOT contain links to `~/_vault/` files
- Only Obsidian vault files may link to other Obsidian vault files
- Links flow: Obsidian → Filesystem (one-way)
- Obsidian notes can reference filesystem locations
- Filesystem content remains link-free
