There are 3 types of documents currently managed here while we are in ALPHA development.

The campaign documents (see campaigns/README.md)
The specification documents (see specifications/wks.md)
Other documents (see other/).

Implementation notes live in the code and tests; there are no per-module README files under wks/.
