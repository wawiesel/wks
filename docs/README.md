There are 4 types of documents currently managed here while we are in ALPHA development.

The campaign documents (see campaigns/README.md)
The specification documents (see ../qa/specs/wks.md)
The traceability audit report (see traceability/traceability_audit.html)
Other documents (see other/).

Implementation notes live alongside the code in `wks/*/README.md`.
