# WKS Roadmap

A forward-looking view of outcomes and constraints. Use this as a compass; the checklists live in `TASKS.md`.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (DONE)

Outcome: A clean baseline with structure, a minimal vault, and a settled spec.
Exit criteria:
- Home has year-scoped work roots; vault skeleton exists; spec is versioned.

## Phase 2 — Migration (DONE)

Outcome: Legacy material is re-homed; staging areas are quiet; embeds reflect truth.
Exit criteria:
- Legacy trees are archived or adopted; loose files are routed; embeds resolve.

## Phase 3 — Agent (IN PROGRESS)

Outcome: A background agent keeps filesystem and vault in sync with minimal noise.
Exit criteria:
- Link drift is corrected automatically; actionable suggestions are surfaced sparingly.

## Phase 4 — Iteration

Outcome: The system improves through measured changes tied to real usage.
Exit criteria:
- A light review cadence exists; pain points are logged and addressed.

## Constraints

- Prefer offline operation and local models.
- Keep the vault readable without plugins; treat helpers as optional.
- Favor small, reversible changes over large refactors.

## Risk Notes

- Naming drift can obscure meaning → normalize proactively.
- Embeds can stale when files move → maintain a consistent `_links/` hub.
- Automation can overreach → require explicit opt‑in for destructive changes.
